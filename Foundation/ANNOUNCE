**************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.24.8, is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=====================================

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

1.2 Noteworthy changes in version `1.24.8'
==========================================

   * Performance optimisations (particularly in the use of tiny string
     objects by the new objc runtime on 64bit systems).

   * Thread naming and logging of threads by NSLog() has been made
     consistent with the latest OSX releases, making debugging of
     multithreaded code a little easier.

   * Sergei Golovin has added NSURLConnection regression tests (while
     fixing a few bugs there).

   * As usual, this release also contains an update to include the most
     recent international timezone data.

   * Various other bugfixes.

1.3 Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
