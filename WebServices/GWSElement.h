/** This little class encapsulates an XML element as part of a simple

 * The [GWSCoder] class creates a tree of these elements
 * when it parses a document.<br />
 * This class aims to produce the most lightweight practical implementation
 * of a tree-structured representation of the subset of XML documents
 * required for web services, so that we have the ease of use advantages
 * of working with an entire document as a tree structure, while
 * minimising performance/efficiency overheads.<br />
 * You probably don't need to use this class directly yourself unless
 * you are writing a new GWSCoder subclass to handle some form of XML
 * serialisation of data (or if you want to bugfix/enhance the existing 
 * GWSCoder subclasses or GWSDocument decodiong/encooding of WSDL).
