2015-08-19 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServerConnection.m: Don't delete close down connections just

	with the client to keep those connections open.

2015-08-18 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServerConnection.m: Don't delete content-encoding header
	which may have been set by the application.

2014-10-02 Sergei Golovin

	* WebServer.m: Fix memory management error ... failure to retain
	the thread used for the main I/O ... was resulting in double
	release of the thread when the WebServer instance was destroyed.

2014-08-04 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.m: Run the main run loop and wait for connections to

	Version 1.5.3:

2014-07-15 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.m:
	* Internal.h:
	Added -setFooldHeaders: methods to turn off header folding either
	for a single response or for all connections established after the
	setting change.
	This is an improvement (bug#41643) to allow the WebServer code to
	be used to respond to clients which don't support folded lines as
	they should.
	NB. No longer fold headers by default ... more libraries support
	long headers than support folding.

        Add support for incremental handling of incoming requests, allowing
        the application to handle partially read requests (once the entre
        header has been read).

2009-12-09 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.m: Workaround for denial of service issues with HTTPS.
	An attacker could connect in and stop responding during the SSL
	handshake.  Because the handshake in gnustep-base has a 30 second
	timeout, this could have two nasty conserquences.
	Firstly the minor issue, if the connection idle timer was short
	enough (and the default is 30 seconds) the connection could time
	out before the handshaker completes.
	The major issue is that the code was not starting a new background
	accept until after the ssl handshake ... so the server would not
	be able to handle any new connections while the handshake was
	taking place.
	The solution is simply to schedule the next accept before performing
	the handshake for the current connection.
